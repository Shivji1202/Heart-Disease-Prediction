# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health indicators.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol level, max heart rate, etc.

## 📊 Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier (best performing model)

## 🧪 Evaluation
- Accuracy: 87.5%
- Precision & Recall metrics available in `classification_report.csv`
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve visuals included

## 📁 Project Structure
- `heart.csv`: Dataset
- `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all steps
- `confusion_matrix.png`, `roc_curve.png`, `feature_importance.png`: Visuals
- `classification_report.csv`: Model performance report

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- More model comparisons (e.g., XGBoost, SVM)
- Streamlit deployment for real-time prediction
